👋 Hi, I’m Maggie Wolff. I'm a data scientist based in Chicago. I currently work in the travel tech industry. I'm also an ambassador with Women in Data Science. 

👀 I’m interested in analysis and prediction related to product and user experiences.

🌱 I’m currently learning Streamlit and upskilling on experimentation and test design.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building communities in analytics & tech, especially for women.

📝 I sometimes share my thoughts on [Medium](https://data-storyteller.medium.com/).

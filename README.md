👋 Hi, I’m Maggie Wolff. 

💼 I'm a data scientist based in Chicago, currently working in the travel tech industry. 

👀 I’m interested in analysis and prediction related to product analytics and user experiences. My work typically focuses on A/B (hypothesis) testing, predictive analytics, reporting & insights, and defining new metrics. The tools I primarily use are Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Adobe Analytics.  

🌱 I recently worked on [measuring user effort and friction and understanding how this impacts the bottom line of a business](https://github.com/maggiewolff/user-effort-index/blob/main/IDEAL%20-%20Maggie%20Wolff%20-%20User%20Effort.pdf).

💞️ I enjoy building communities in analytics & tech. I'm an ambassador with [Women in Data Science](https://www.widsconference.org/) and help organize the annual [WiDS Chicago conference](https://widschicago.org/), I help organize [MeasureCamp Chicago](https://chicago.measurecamp.org/), and you can usually find me in one of these [Slack communities](https://data-storyteller.medium.com/list-of-data-analytics-online-communities-70831894aef7). 

📝 I share my thoughts on [Medium](https://data-storyteller.medium.com/), especially on how to break into the analytics field and how to network effectively. I also occasionally [present at conferences](https://maggiewolff.github.io/talks/).
